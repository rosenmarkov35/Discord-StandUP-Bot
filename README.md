# üõ†Ô∏è StandUP Bot

**StandUP** is a powerful Discord bot designed to streamline team check-ins and ticket management within your server. With scheduled standups, role-based access, and a flexible ticketing system, it helps teams stay organized and accountable.

---

## üì¶ Features

### üåü Standup System

* Daily or weekly asynchronous standup check-ins
* Fully configurable questions, time, timezone, and days
* Role-based reminders and summary logs
* Interactive embeds and visual feedback for all actions, including standup previews, ticket updates, and responses, creating a user-friendly and informative experience

### üéüÔ∏è Ticket Management

* Users can submit tickets with a single command
* Mods can assign tickets to roles/members
* Dedicated thread creation for each ticket
* Structured embed updates and comment tracking

### üîí Role-based Access

* `StandupMod` role: full control over standup configuration
* `TicketMod` role: manage and assign tickets

---

## üîß Prerequisites

Before using StandUP Bot, make sure the following roles, channels, and settings are configured. These are required for the bot to function correctly.

#### Discord Server

* The bot must be invited and installed into a Discord server so create one before continuing.


### Required Roles & Channels

#### TicketMod Role

* Users with this role can manage, assign, and oversee support tickets.
* The role must be named exactly `TicketMod` for permissions to work properly.

#### StandupMod Role

* Grants access to all standup configuration and scheduling commands.
* The role must be named exactly `StandupMod`.

#### mod-tickets Channel

* A private text channel for moderators with the `TicketMod` role.
* The bot posts new ticket embeds here for review and assignment.
* This name must match exactly.

  
    It is suggested to use a private-channel for "StandupMod" members where standup
    check-ins configurtaion via commands is done so commands dont fill the general
    text channels.

## üéûÔ∏è Hosting Guide (Railway)

Clients will receive the StandUP Bot as a **precompiled ZIP package**, ready to deploy. No Git setup is required.

We recommend **[Railway](https://railway.app/)** for easy and reliable deployment of Python bots.

---

### üß© Why Railway?

- Simple UI and fast setup
- Supports environment variables
- Always-on deployments
- Free tier available for small-scale usage

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (ZIP Build)

1. **Create a Railway Account**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app/)
   - Sign up or log in with GitHub

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click **"New Project"**
   - Select **"Deploy from Repository"** (skip this and choose **"Blank Project"** if you're uploading files manually)

3. **Upload Your Bot Files**
   - Extract the provided `.zip` archive
   - Drag and drop all files (e.g. `bot.pyc`, `requirements.txt`, `license.txt`, `.env`, etc.) into the Railway **"Deployments"** section

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Go to the **"Variables"** tab
   - Add:
     ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
     ```
   - Ensure any other `.env` variables used in your bot are also added

5. **Configure Startup Command**
   - Go to the **"Settings"** tab ‚Üí Scroll to **"Start Command"**
   - Set:
     ```bash
     python bot.pyc
     ```

6. **Deploy**
   - Hit **"Deploy"** and Railway will spin up your bot
   - Monitor logs in real-time via the Railway dashboard

---

### ‚úÖ Notes

- If your ZIP includes obfuscated/compiled Python (`.pyc`) files, make sure you include the required runtime files (`__pycache__` or `requirements.txt`).
- Do **not** include the raw `.env` file in public repositories or ZIPs. Clients should set their secrets using Railway‚Äôs UI.
- The bot will automatically handle internal data storage using JSON, so no external DB setup is needed.

For further help with Railway, see their [official docs](https://docs.railway.app/).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The bot currently supports a **maximum of 60 open tickets** at any given time. Once this limit is reached, users will be unable to submit new tickets until some are resolved or closed.
- Please note that **Discord rate limits** may affect how often the bot can send messages or perform certain actions, especially if multiple commands are triggered in rapid succession. The bot handles most rate limits gracefully, but large servers should monitor usage accordingly.
- Tickets, role and thread management rely on **role/channel names being correctly configured** (see [üîß Prerequisites](#-prerequisites)).

---

## üß™ Testing Tips

* Use a private test server with test roles set up
* Use `/preview` often to confirm standup layout
* Manually verify ticket threads, assignment tagging, and role access
